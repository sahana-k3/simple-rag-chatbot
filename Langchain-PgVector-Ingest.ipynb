      "Myopia occurs if the eyeball is too long or the cornea (the clear frontcover of the eye) is too curved. As a result, the light entering the eyeisn't focused correctly, and distant objects look blurred. Myopia affectsnearly 30% of the U.S. population. While the exact cause of myopia isunknown, there is significant evidence that many people inheritmyopia, or at least the tendency to develop myopia. If one or bothparents are nearsighted, there is an increased chance their childrenwill be nearsighted. Even though the tendency to develop myopia maybe inherited, its actual development may be affected by how a personuses his or her eyes. Individuals who spend considerable time reading,working at a computer , playing video games or doing other intenseclose visual work may be more likely to develop myopia. In fact, highlevels of screen time on smart devices (i.e. looking at a smart phone) isassociated with around a 30% higher risk of myopia and, whencombined with excessive computer use, that risk rose to around 80%.\n",
